🎓 AI in Education: Personalized Learning System | Python Project for Beginners
 I present a beginner-friendly Python project that simulates an AI-based Personalized Learning System — perfect for students, internships, and GitHub portfolios!

🔍 **Project Overview:**
This system recommends personalized learning resources like videos, articles, or quizzes based on a user's test/quiz score and their preferred learning style (Video/Text/Practice). It's built using Python and rule-based AI logic.

📌 **Key Features:**
- Takes quiz/test score input
- Learner selects their preferred study style
- Recommends content categorized by level: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced
- Uses structured JSON data for easy updates
- Simple console-based app (no complex GUI)

💻 **Tech Stack:**
- Python
- JSON
- Basic AI logic
- Command-line interaction

🧠 **What You'll Learn:**
- How to build recommendation systems
- Simple AI decision logic in Python
- Using JSON files for data organization
